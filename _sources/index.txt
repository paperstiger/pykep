PyKEP is a scientific library providing basic tools for astrodynamics research. Algoritmic efficiency is 
a main focus of the library, which is written in C++ and exposed to Python using the boost::python library. At the library core
is the implementation of an efficient solver for the multiple revolutions Lambert's problem, objects representing the Sims-Flanagan low-thrust model,
efficient keplerian propagators, Taylor-integrators and more ....
